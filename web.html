            <p class="card-text">cookies, can be at room temperature before baking; the spoonfuls of dough will spread and
                flatten out to the desired result. Room temperature butter is best for creaming together butter and
                sugar. Chilled butter is best for cutting butter into flour.

                decoration or image to be applied to the top of the cake with the same clarity as a magazine print! The
                photo cake image is designed on a computer and printed directly onto the edible page using approved
